# React currency converter widget

Based on our own 100% free API for [exchange rates](https://algobook.info/docs/exchange-rates-api), we have created a widget which can be used to convert currencies based on the latest rates. We support 30+ currencies, check our [docs](https://algobook.info/docs/currency-converter) for more info. The data we are using is originated from the European Central Bank.

The widget is fully customizable when it comes to styling, just provide your own className to it and do what suits you and your project the best.
